Proxy.sh Warrant Canary

Proxy.sh believes that respect of privacy is of the utmost importance in today's world. Nonetheless, many jurisdictions throughout the world still permit some legitimate or illegitimate authorities to compromise people's privacy in the context of the rules of law. This includes, but is not limited to, the U.S. Patriot Act or the British H.R. 1981. Such laws would provide relevant warrant, search or seizure in the context of criminal investigations, while forbidding the disclosure of such events to the entire affected user base.

Proxy.sh already stated through its Ethical Policy that it would not hesitate to relocate to another jurisdiction if such law is employed in such way that would lead to compromising the privacy of its customers.

Nonetheless, Proxy.sh believes a Warrant Canary is a valuable addition, in order to confer always the most useful transparency. Indeed, between the time we are served with a legal request that would compromise our customers' privacy and the well being of our ethical policy, and the time we can technically cease operations in a specific jurisdiction and relocate to somewhere else, we might be subject to the terrible consequences explained earlier.

This is to tackle this problem that Proxy.sh will make available, on a daily basis, a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:

- A declaration of honor, provided by our senior network engineer, Boian Mihailov, who certifies that, to the date of publication, no warrants, searches or seizures that have not been reported in our Transparency Report, have actually taken place;

- An excerpt of headlines from the Financial Times, a news source with great reputation, in order to establish the date.

As per pointed out by our comrades from rsync.net, "special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page."

The below "warrant canary" has been generated on: 2015-03-28

NB:

This notice is not 100% bulletproof. It is clearly signed by us, and the idea is that, while we may be forced not to talk about an intervention, we cannot be prevented from actually remaining silent. The contrary would mean that we are forced both not to talk, and, to keep talking. Despite this non-sense, a legal onus exists and lies in whether we could be forced to keep publishing such notice no matter if it is proven false -- in other words, the question is whether we may be forced to state false information for the benefit of the underlying investigation. By deciding to move forward with this notice, Proxy.sh hereby clarifies its standpoint on whether it is ready to challenge the ambiguities of the law for the sake of its customer's privacy.
